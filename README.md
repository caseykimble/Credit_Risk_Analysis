# Credit Risk Analysis

### Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to apply machine learning models to evaluate credit card risk.

Using a credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, I used several machine learning methods to review whether or not they should be used to predict credit risk. 

The following methods were used:
* oversampling with RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms
* undersampling with ClusterCentroids algorithm
* combination over- and undersampling using SMOTEENN algorithm
* models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier

Following these steps, I will evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on their predictability for credit risk.

### Results

Cluster Centroids, Naive Random Oversampling, SMOTE oversampling, SMOTEENN over and under sampling, BalancedRandomForest, EasyEnsemble

### Summary





Deliverable 4: Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis
For this deliverable, youâ€™ll write a brief summary and analysis of the performance of all the machine learning models used in this Challenge.

The report should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
