# Credit Risk Analysis

### Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to apply machine learning models to evaluate credit card risk.

Using a credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, I used several machine learning methods to review whether or not they should be used to predict credit risk. 

The following methods were used:
* oversampling with RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms
* undersampling with ClusterCentroids algorithm
* combination over- and undersampling using SMOTEENN algorithm
* models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier

Following these steps, I will evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on their predictability for credit risk.
